# Working with null values

This repository holds samples of solution which helps me to deal with null values.
I was inspired by a blog post of Steffen Forkman ([@forki](https://github.com/forki)) who described the need to consider this topic.
- [A tale of nulls – part I] (http://www.navision-blog.de/blog/2013/04/03/a-tale-of-nulls/)

The [history] (https://github.com/GregOnNet/WorkingWithNullValues/commits/master) of this repository will show my progress on this subject. ;)
